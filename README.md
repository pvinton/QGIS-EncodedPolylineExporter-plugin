QGIS-Plugins
============

Plugin installation directions: 

1) Copy everything in the "dist" folder to your QGIS plugin directory.  On my machine, my plugin directory is:
      C:\Users\pvinton\.qgis2\python\plugins
   
   The end result should look something like this:
     C:\Users\pvinton\.qgis2\python\plugins\encodedPolyline
    
2) The next time you start QGIS, go to  Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins

3) In the “Installed” section, check the box next to “Encoded Polyline Exporter”

4) Once checked, you should see an Analytics8 logo on your toobar.  If you don’t, right-click on your toolbar and make sure “Plugins” is checked.
